# Test Driven Development Example Code
The code in this repository is the example code that Kent Beck used in his book "Test Driven Development: By Example". 
It demonstrates the principles of Test Driven Development (TDD) chapter by chapter according to the examples in the book.
I have created separate examples for each chapter and I have also provided code in Java and C#. I may add a Python version later.
